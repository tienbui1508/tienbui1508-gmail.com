Hi, I am **Tien (Tim) Bui** :wave:,<br>

With a Master of Information Technology from Flinders University, I am eager to launch my career in IT. While I am in the early stages of my professional journey, my background includes extensive university projects and a strong commitment to continuous learning.<br>

I am actively honing my skills in software engineering, particularly with C# and .NET, while also developing my data analysis expertise using Power BI, SQL, and Excel. My [**portfolio**](/projects/) demonstrates my dedication and ability to work across various technologies.

I am enthusiastic about both **software development** and **data analytics** and am seeking an **entry-level role** to gain practical experience and contribute effectively to a team. Explore my [**portfolio**](/projects/) to see my tech projects and skills. If you’re looking for a motivated IT professional with a passion for learning and growth, please [**get in touch**](/contact/).
